# Employee table and chart

This is a web app that displays a table list of employees with infinite scroll, fetched from a locally served API. It allows the user to search for employees by name and displays a graph which shows the hierarchy of employees based on position. It was made in React (Vite), styled with Material-UI and uses react-orgchart to display the chart. The data is served on a local API run by Docker Desktop, that can be found on `http://localhost:8000/api/employees`, which my app connects to with api url saved in `.env` file. 

## Features

- Home component where the user can select the route to `Zaposlenici` or `Dijagram` page
- List of employees in a table with infinite scroll and lazy loading
- Search employees by name
- Organizational chart made with [react-orgchart](https://github.com/nater1067/react-orgchart/tree/master)
